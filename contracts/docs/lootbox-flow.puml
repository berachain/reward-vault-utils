' Notes
note right of LB
  Three versions:
  - Open immediately
  - Open later (no trading)
  - Open later (with trading)
end note

note right of RARITY
  Rolls correspond to loot box rarities
  Specific rarity minted based on roll or none
end note

note right of BGTPOOL
  Redemption:
  - Redeems bounded ranges of available BGT
  - On opening
end note

note bottom of LB
  Caveats:
  - Rarities must be against current BGT allocation
  - Expected value on deferred claims can change
    as people open boxes
end note
